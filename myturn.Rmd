This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Necessary libraries:
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width,color = Species)) +
 geom_point(aes(shape = Species)) + #changes the shape for each species
  # scale_color_manual(values = c("purple",
  #                               "black",
  #                               "orange"))+
geom_smooth(se= FALSE)
  

summary(lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width + Species, data = iris))


ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) + 
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red")


  ```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
